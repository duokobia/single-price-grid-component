## Overview
This is my first Frontend Mentor challenge. The task is undertaken with an intent to improve my frontend development skills as a junior frontend developer.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

A wireframe sketch was used to approximate dimensions and how to set up the grid layouts. Remote git repository was created for the project before development commenced.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Non Mobile-first approach 

### What I learned

- There are more efficient usage of CSS Grid. 
- I am opened to comments about how to improve my frontend skills. 
- There is always something new to learner for dynamic minds.


### Continued development

- using CSS grid for more complex projects this would involves higher degree of css grid manipulation.
- More knowlegde acquistion on CSS grid and writing cleaner codes. 
- better naming convention used for future projects such as BEM.
- Media querry with advanced website layouts.
